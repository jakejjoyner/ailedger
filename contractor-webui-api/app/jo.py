"""Jo chat — `claude --print` subprocess per turn, streamed via SSE.

Architecture note: an earlier version of this module kept a long-lived
interactive `claude` process alive per Jo session via pexpect. Under
`sudo -u <contractor>` that approach never produced output — claude's
interactive TUI refuses to initialize when its grandparent is sudo-over-
pty. Rewritten to spawn `claude --print --session-id <uuid>` per user
message; subsequent turns use `--resume <uuid>` so the conversation
persists on disk and claude picks up prior context. Trade: ~1-2s
startup cost per turn; wins: works through the sudo boundary, simpler
lifecycle, no pty management.

Strict-confidence preservation (per feedback_pasha_jo_transcripts_strict_confidence):
  - Transcript BODIES are never logged — only session ids, timestamps,
    approximate token counts, and error codes.
  - Each claude subprocess runs under the contractor's Linux user when
    JO_SPAWN_SUDO_USER is set; its on-disk session file lives in that
    user's home and is unreadable by jjoyner.
  - A principal reading the FastAPI logs sees that a session ran, not
    what was said.

        Returns ``None`` when the inbox yields nothing in the window.

        Framed as ``[SESSION CONTEXT — ...]`` so Jo treats it as loaded
        state, not a speak-now directive: a later "what's the latest?"
        question can be answered from this without kicking the ask back
        at the contractor. Full bodies live under ``publish_box``; Jo
        can ``Read`` them on demand when a specific item needs depth.
