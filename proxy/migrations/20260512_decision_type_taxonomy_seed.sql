-- Migration: decision_type taxonomy + seed data
--
-- Context: AILedger posture v2. Decision Event records reference a
-- decision_type from a fixed taxonomy aligned with EU AI Act Annex III
-- high-risk categories. Spec at ~/workspace/dev/ailedger/CLAUDE.md.
--
-- Note: `law_enforcement` is kept in the taxonomy for completeness but is
-- refused at intake per Charter v1.2 ("Customers we refuse"). The ingest
-- API must reject decision_events with decision_type='law_enforcement'.
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run. Adding rows uses on-conflict-do-nothing so
-- pre-existing rows are preserved.

-- The application layer (proxy / decision-event ingest endpoint) must
-- reject incoming Decision Events with decision_type values where
-- refused_at_intake = true. This is enforced in code, not schema, because
-- the value should be visible in the taxonomy for documentation, audit,
-- and migration purposes. Test v2-T12 (refused-customer-at-intake) in
-- docs/ailedger-test-plan.md covers this enforcement path.
